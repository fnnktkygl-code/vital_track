ARNOLD EHRET — MUCUSLESS DIET HEALING SYSTEM
Prof. Arnold Ehret, 1866–1922

=== CORE PHILOSOPHY ===

Arnold Ehret's Mucusless Diet Healing System (MDHS) teaches that every disease is caused by clogged tissues from uneliminated, undigested, and unnatural food substances (mucus). The body heals itself through fasting and a mucus-free diet of fruits and green-leaf vegetables.

Key Principles:
- Every disease, regardless of name, is caused by constipation (clogging of the entire pipe system)
- Mucus is the primary cause of all disease — it clogs tissues, organs, blood, and the entire system
- Vitality = Power (P) minus Obstruction (O). Formula: V = P - O
- The human body is an air-gas engine, not a machine that runs on protein or calories
- Fruit is the perfect food — closest to sunlight and air
- Fasting is nature's supreme remedy, but must be done rationally

=== THE MUCUSLESS DIET ===

MUCUS-FREE FOODS (Healing / Optimal):
- All raw fruits (especially citrus, grapes, cherries, berries, figs, dates)
- All green-leaf vegetables (raw or conservatively cooked)
- Nuts in moderation (not peanuts — they are legumes)

MUCUS-LEAN FOODS (Transition / Acceptable):
- Cooked vegetables (non-starchy)
- Dried fruits (figs, dates, raisins)
- Starchless bread (if needed during transition only)
- Raw and cooked tomatoes

MUCUS-FORMING FOODS (To Eliminate):
- All meat, fish, eggs, dairy products
- All grains and cereals (wheat, rice, oats, corn)
- All starchy vegetables (potatoes, beans, lentils)
- All fats and oils (including olive oil — controversial vs. Dr. Sebi)
- Refined sugar, white flour, processed foods
- Coffee, tea (except herbal), alcohol

=== TRANSITION DIET ===

Ehret emphasized that one must NOT jump directly into a fruit diet:
- The body is loaded with mucus and toxins from years of wrong eating
- A sudden cleanse can release too many toxins at once (healing crisis)
- Gradual transition over weeks/months is essential

TRANSITION PHASES:
1. Phase 1 — Elimination: Remove the worst offenders (meat, dairy, white flour, sugar)
2. Phase 2 — Combination: Meals of cooked non-starchy vegetables + salad, one type of fruit per meal
3. Phase 3 — Raw predominant: Mostly raw fruits and green leaves, minimal cooked food
4. Phase 4 — Fruit diet: Mono-fruit meals or fruit combinations
5. Phase 5 — Fasting: Short fasts (24-72h) interspersed with fruit meals

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Never mix fruits and vegetables in the same meal
- Eat one type of fruit at a time when possible (mono-eating)
- Do not eat too many varieties at one meal
- Lemon juice and orange juice are powerful mucus solvents
- A short fast is better than a "perfect" meal

=== FASTING PRINCIPLES ===

Ehret considered fasting "Nature's Operating Table":
- Short fasts (24-36 hours) repeated frequently are safer than long fasts
- Break fasts gently with fruit (orange, grapes) or laxative foods
- Enemas are recommended during fasting to help elimination
- Do not fast if too weak — eat mucus-lean foods instead
- The "mirror of the tongue" reveals elimination progress (white coating = mucus being expelled)

FASTING PROGRESSION:
- Beginners: 24-hour fast, once a week
- Intermediate: 36-48 hour fasts
- Advanced: 3-7 day fasts (with experience only)
- Always break the fast with juicy fruits, never heavy foods

=== EHRET'S HEALING CRISIS ===

When transitioning, the body will experience "crises":
- Headaches, fatigue, skin eruptions, bad breath, dark urine
- These are NOT signs of illness — they are signs of HEALING
- The body is eliminating stored toxins and mucus
- Slow down the transition if symptoms are too intense
- Resume eating mucus-lean foods temporarily if needed

=== THE VITALITY FORMULA ===

V = P - O (Vitality = Power minus Obstruction)
- P (Power) comes from air, oxygen, and clean food (fruit)
- O (Obstruction) comes from mucus, toxins, and waste in the tissues
- A perfectly clean body on a fruit diet would have unlimited energy
- Disease = the body's obstruction exceeds its power to eliminate

=== FOOD COMBINING ===

Ehret's food combining rules:
- Never mix fruits with vegetables
- Never mix acid fruits with sweet fruits
- Eat melons alone, always
- Fats slow digestion — avoid mixing with fruit
- One type of food per meal is ideal (mono-eating)
- Green-leaf salads can be eaten before a cooked vegetable meal (not after)

=== KEY DIFFERENCES FROM DR. SEBI ===

While both Ehret and Dr. Sebi agree on fruits and greens:
- Ehret rejected ALL oils; Dr. Sebi approved cold-pressed plant oils
- Ehret allowed some cooked vegetables in transition; Dr. Sebi preferred raw
- Ehret focused on the mechanical concept of mucus; Dr. Sebi on the mineral/electrical concept
- Both agreed: no meat, no dairy, no processed foods, no starch

=== KEY QUOTES ===

"Every disease is caused by a clogging of the tiny blood vessels — the capillaries — by mucus."
"What the average person calls health is in reality a latent disease condition."
"Life is a tragedy of nutrition."
"The fruit diet is the diet of paradise — it is the only diet for humans."
"Nature does not provide a food which must be prepared by man to be eaten."
"Fasting is the key to the door of God's kitchen."
