DR. SEBI — NUTRITIONAL GUIDE & METHODOLOGY
Alfonso Alfredo Bowman (Dr. Sebi), 1933–2016

=== CORE PHILOSOPHY ===

Dr. Sebi's African Bio-Mineral Balance is based on the principle that all disease stems from mucus accumulation and acidity in the body. The body is electrical in nature, and only natural, non-hybrid, alkaline plant foods can properly nourish the cells.

Key Principles:
- Disease cannot exist in an alkaline environment
- The body is made of minerals and must be fed minerals
- Only natural (non-hybrid) plants provide the correct electrical nutrition
- Starch is a chemical binder that causes inflammation and mucus
- The body heals itself when properly nourished and cleansed

=== DR. SEBI CELL FOOD COMPOUNDS ===

Key herbal compounds recommended by Dr. Sebi:
- Bromide Plus: Sea moss, Bladderwrack, Burdock root (iron, iodine, minerals)
- Bio Ferro: Iron phosphate tonic for blood and energy
- Chelation: Heavy metal removal with cascara sagrada, prodigiosa
- Viento: Respiratory support with gordolobo, eucalyptus
- Green Food: Concentrated alkaline nutrition

=== IRON & MINERAL PHILOSOPHY ===

Dr. Sebi emphasized that iron is the most important mineral:
- Iron carries oxygen to every cell
- Iron deficiency (anemia) is at the root of most diseases
- Plant-based iron sources: sea moss, burdock root, sarsaparilla, yellow dock, dandelion, quinoa, amaranth
- Iron absorption enhanced by Vitamin C from Key Limes

=== WATER ===

- Spring water ONLY (minimum 1 gallon per day)
- No tap water, no distilled water, no reverse osmosis
- Water must contain natural minerals
- Warm water with Key Lime juice in the morning

=== FASTING ===

Dr. Sebi recommended periodic fasting:
- Water fasting with herbal teas for deep cleansing
- Fruit fasting as a gentler alternative
- Gradual transition: cooked alkaline foods → raw alkaline → fruit → juice → water
- Fasting accelerates the removal of inorganic calcium deposits and mucus

=== KEY QUOTES ===

"If it has a label, do not eat it."
"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food — but only if the food is natural."
"There is only one disease: the compromising of the mucous membrane."
"Starch is a chemical. It is a binder that causes inflammation."
"The African Bio-Mineral Balance cleanses and nourishes at the cellular level."
